          <p>I am a Japanese Individual named Marina Murasaki called purple, and I have a strong passion for programming, Disney, and various types of food. As an international student, my journey through TAFE in Australia has been a novel experience, not only for me but also my family. Curretly, I am pursuing a course in web development at TAFE QLD. My enthusiasm for programming is a driving force behind my studies. I believe that my skills in web development will allow me to create innovative and user-friednly websites and applications that could be valuable assets for businesses. Being in a foreign country and navigating student life as an international student has provided me with numerous opportunities for growth and learning. I constantly adapt to new challengies and strive to achieve my goal.

      <h3>Future Goals</h3>
      <p> As an advocate for diversity and inclusion within the web development field, I am passionate about linking websites all over the world. This interconnectedness can foster collaboration, understanding, and knowledge exchange among people from diverse backgrounds, cultures, and regions.

        Also, I aspire to be a web developer. Through my journey, I aim to create accessible and user-friendly websites that cater to the needs of all individuals, regardless of their abilities, languages spoken, or technological resources. Embracing diversity in web development not only enhances user experiences but also promotes a more inclusive digital landscape.
        
        I believe that by championing diversity in technology and encouraging underrepresented groups to participate in web development, we can build a more equitable and innovative online environment. As I progress in my career, I intend to actively promote diversity within the industry and support initiatives that bridge the digital divide worldwide.</p>
